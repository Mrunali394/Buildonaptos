# FreelancePlatform: Decentralized Job Management System

## Introduction

FreelancePlatform is a blockchain-based decentralized platform designed to streamline interactions between freelancers and clients. Built on the Aptos blockchain, it offers a transparent and secure environment for job creation, management, and payment. Freelancers can list jobs with predefined payments, and clients can approve the completion of tasks, ensuring an automated and trustless payment process.

The smart contract supports:
1. **Job Creation:** Freelancers can register new jobs with payment details.
2. **Job Approval and Payment Release:** Clients can approve completed jobs, triggering a secure payment transfer.
